\section{Problem and Approach}
% conext:
% This is a secitoin talking about the problem that we are facing in this ?project. The project is about Indystry 4.0 in a livestock farm setting.
% we have differnet services and serves in a Java-based agricultural management system for cattle farming that integrates several services: an Outbound Department for order management, a Laboratory/QA for product testing and compliance monitoring, and a Farmer GUI for user interactions. It employs a Message Bus for inter-service communication and Bio-monitoring for livestock health tracking, utilizing both MySQL and semi-structured databases. An Inbound service manages stock and orders, while the Feed System oversees feed conditions and inventory. The system is sensor-reliant, with various sensors providing real-time data on cattle health, environmental conditions, and feed storage, interfacing with a Hadoop big data server for analytics and reporting.

\emph{Problem.}
In livestock farming, the production process is highly dependent on the environment and the health of the animals. To address this the system that has been developed in this project aims to look into how differnet arcitectural approaches can bridge differnet services and servers in a way that the production process can be reconfigured to adapt to the changes in the environment and the health of the animals. To approach this problem the following research questions are formulated:
