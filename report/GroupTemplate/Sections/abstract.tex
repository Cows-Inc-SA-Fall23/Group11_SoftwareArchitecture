The following paper presents the results that were achieved by the group in the course Advanced topics in software architecture at the University of Southern Denmark. The focus of the project was to design a software architecture in the conext of Industry 4.0 and smart farming with a focus on livestock farming. Within the domain of smart farming for livestock there has for many years been a lack of adoption for Industry 4.0 concepts. The goal for the project were then to identify the challenges that are present in the domain and design and develop a prototype that incorporates industry 4.0 concepts and showcases how such a system might look like. Related work showed a commond challenge for system to communicate together. The system is evaluated based on different quality attributes and quality attribute scenarios. The results of the evaluation shows that the system is able to adhere to the defined quality attributes and quality attribute scenarios.
