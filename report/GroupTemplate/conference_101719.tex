    The following paper presents the results that were achieved by the group in the course Advanced topics in software architecture at the University of Southern Denmark. The focus of the project was to design a software architecture in the conext of Industry 4.0 and smart farming with a focus on livestock farming. Within the domain of smart farming for livestock there has for many years been a lack of adoption for Industry 4.0 concepts. The goal for the project were then to identify the challenges that are present in the domain and design and develop a prototype that incorporates industry 4.0 concepts and showcases how such a system might look like. Related work showed a common challenge for system to communicate together. The system is evaluated based on different quality attributes and quality attribute scenarios. The results of the evaluation shows that the system is able to adhere to the defined quality attributes and quality attribute scenarios.

\section{Conclusion}
A proposed software architecture has been designed and evaluated based on the developed Quality Attribute Scenarios (QASes). This architecture includes a detailed description of the system's components and their interactions, providing an architectural overview that clarifies the system design. The evaluation results demonstrate the system's compliance with the defined QASes, supporting the conclusion that the architecture possesses the necessary elements to meet the system requirements.\\
The system design is grounded in both literature and the specific requirements of the system. While there are trade-offs associated with the design choices made, the paper presents justifications for why the selected technologies are the most suitable solutions. These trade-offs include the complexity of certain systems and a minor impact on performance. As noted in the section on future work, further refinement of requirements is essential for practical implementation in a farm setting
