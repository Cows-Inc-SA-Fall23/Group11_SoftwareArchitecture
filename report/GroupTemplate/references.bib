  abstract = {The current manufacturing environment aims at getting an increasing variety of customised, high-quality products in flexible batches. The dynamic market demand, the short product lifecycle and the flexibility need mark the transition from the traditional manufacturing systems to the so-called Next Generation Manufacturing Systems (NGMSs). Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems (RMSs) are within NGMSs and seem to match to these current market trends. RMSs allow rapid change in structure, hardware and software configuration to adjust, promptly, their production capacity and functionality. This paper presents a structured and updated systematic review of the literature about RMSs, highlighting the application areas as well as the key methodologies and tools. The review further provides a schematic of RMS research, identifying five emerging and promising research streams ranging from conceptual models to empirical applications. Compared to previous reviews, focusing on specific aspects of the RMS design and management, this study covers multiple areas and topics and it links reconfigurable manufacturing to the upcoming Industry 4.0 fourth industrial revolution. Finally, important issues and new trends in the literature are outlined to stimulate researchers and practitioners in developing studies in this field strongly linked to the Industry 4.0 environment.}

The agent uses ontological knowledge of the manufacturing environment for the purpose of reconfiguration without human intervention. The current mass customization era requires increased flexibility and agility in the manufacturing systems to adapt changes in manufacturing requirements and environments. Our configuration agent minimises the overheads of the current reconfiguration process by automating it. It infers facts about the manufacturing environment from the ontological knowledge model and then decides whether the current environment can support the given manufacturing requirements. This paper proposes the agent architecture enabling the integration between the high level planning with the distributed low level control compliant with the upcoming IEC 61499 function blocks standard.}

  abstract  = {Industry 4.0 aims at evolving the current industrial processes towards directly connecting shopfloor machines to systems from different layers of the automation pyramid, such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) or Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES). There are key functional and quality requirements that apply to most Industry 4.0 systems independent of the application domain, e.g., requirements related to interoperability, recoverability, security, and modifiability. Despite their importance, there is still a lack of understanding of (i) architecture drivers that focus on these quality aspects and (ii) architecture solutions for these architecture drivers that are adequate for a wide range of Industry 4.0 contexts. To contribute to filling this gap, we present in this paper (i) quality-centered architecture drivers derived from industrial cases, and (ii) architecture solutions based on the concepts of Digital Twins, Service-Oriented Architecture, and Virtual Automation Bus for four recurrent production plant scenarios. The architecture drivers and solutions presented in this paper were instantiated in different Industry 4.0 contexts, such as BaSys 4.0 (the German national reference project for Industry 4.0), and by the BaSys industry project partners.},

  abstract       = {The present review retraces the steps of the industrial and agriculture revolution that have taken place up to the present day, giving ideas and considerations for the future. This paper analyses the specific challenges facing agriculture along the farming supply chain to permit the operative implementation of Industry 4.0 guidelines. The subsequent scientific value is an investigation of how Industry 4.0 approaches can be improved and be pertinent to the agricultural sector. However, industry is progressing at a much faster rate than agriculture. In fact, already today experts talk about Industry 5.0. On the other hand, the 4.0 revolution in agriculture is still limited to a few innovative firms. For this reason, this work deals with how technological development affects different sectors (industry and agriculture) in different ways. In this innovative background, despite the advantages of industry or agriculture 4.0 for large enterprises, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) often face complications in such innovative processes due to the continuous development in innovations and technologies. Policy makers should propose strategies, calls for proposals with aim of supporting SMEs to invest on these technologies and making them more competitive in the marketplace.},

  abstract = {Smart farming is a management style that includes smart monitoring, planning and control of agricultural processes. This management style requires the use of a wide variety of software and hardware systems from multiple vendors. Adoption of smart farming is hampered because of a poor interoperability and data exchange between ICT components hindering integration. Software Ecosystems is a recent emerging concept in software engineering that addresses these integration challenges. Currently, several Software Ecosystems for farming are emerging. To guide and accelerate these developments, this paper provides a reference architecture for Farm Software Ecosystems. This reference architecture should be used to map, assess design and implement Farm Software Ecosystems. A key feature of this architecture is a particular configuration approach to connect ICT components developed by multiple vendors in a meaningful, feasible and coherent way. The reference architecture is evaluated by verification of the design with the requirements and by mapping two existing Farm Software Ecosystems using the Farm Software Ecosystem Reference Architecture. This mapping showed that the reference architecture provides insight into Farm Software Ecosystems as it can describe similarities and differences. A main conclusion is that the two existing Farm Software Ecosystems can improve configuration of different ICT components. Future research is needed to enhance configuration in Farm Software Ecosystems.}

  abstract       = {The term &rdquo;Agriculture 4.0&rdquo; emerged from the term &ldquo;Industry 4.0&rdquo; like amany other &ldquo;4.0&rdquo; terms. However, are Industry 4.0 technologies and concepts really applicable to agriculture? Are the benefits that Industry 4.0 brings to industrial use cases transferable to livestock farming? This paper tries to answer this question for the three dominant sectors of livestock farming in Central Europe and Germany: Poultry, pig fattening, and dairy farming. These sectors are analyzed along with the eight most relevant Industry 4.0 benefits. The results show that only part of the Industry 4.0 benefits are relevant for livestock farming in a similar manner as in industrial production. Due to basic differences between industrial and livestock farming use cases, some of the benefits must be adapted. The presence of individual living animals and the strong environmental impact of livestock farming affect the role of digital individualization and demand orientation. The position of livestock farming within the value chain minimizes the need for flexibilization. The introduction and adoption of Industry 4.0 concepts and technologies may contribute significantly to transforming agriculture into something that may be called Agriculture 4.0. Technologies are indispensable for this development step, but vocational education and open-mindedness of farmers towards Industry 4.0 is essential as well.},

The Internet of Things (IoT) may serve as an enabler to ensure key properties&mdash;such as interconnectivity, scalability, agility, and interoperability&mdash;in IFM systems so that they could provide object-based services while adapting to dynamic changes. This paper focuses on the problem of facilitating the management, processing, and sharing of the vast and heterogeneous data points generated in livestock facilities by introducing distributed IoT middleware as the core of a responsive and adaptive service-oriented IFM system, specifically targeted to enable smart livestock farming in view of its unique requirements. The proposed IoT middleware encompasses the context-awareness approach via the integration of a flexible ontology-based structure for modeling and reasoning. The IoT middleware was assessed in actual conditions on the grounds of a case study for smart control of the thermal environment in a medium-sized pig farming facility. As derived from the obtained evaluation results, the system appears to perform quite satisfactorily in terms of computational performance as well as ontology coherence, consistency, and efficiency.},

This modern technological approach to animal farming and production encompasses ethical, economic and logistical aspects. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of PLF and Industry 4.0, to identify current applications of this rather novel approach in different farming systems for food producing animals, and to present up to date knowledge on the subject. Current scientific literature regarding the spread and application of PLF and IoT shows how efficient farm animal management systems are destined to become. Everyday farming practices (feeding and production performance) coupled with continuous and real-time monitoring of animal parameters can have significant impacts on welfare and health assessment, which are current themes of public interest. In the context of feeding a rising global population, the agri-food industry and industry 4.0 technologies may represent key features for successful and sustainable development.},

  abstract = {Precision, sustainability and intelligence are the development trend of livestock farming in the future. Precision livestock farming (PLF) is a key step to achieve the sustainable development of smart farms, but it is still in the initial stage and has broad prospects. In order to realize precise livestock production, it is necessary to speed up the popularization of intelligent technologies such as environmental control, disease early warning, precise feeding and remote diagnosis. By analyzing the background and technical features of wearable Internet of Things (W-IoT), this paper puts forward a new scheme of applying W-IoT to PLF. Through the detailed survey of the related research on W-IoT and PLF, we believe that precise perception of information, biocompatibility of wearable devices, and sustainability monitoring of wearable systems are necessary contents. However, most wearable technologies that can generate precise, dynamic and sustainable signals are only applicable to humans, and rarely modified or tested specifically for farm animals. At present, these innovative technologies are gradually promoted to livestock farming, which are expected to become one of the most effective solutions for PLF in smart farms. In addition, this paper also discusses the benefits, challenges and prospects of the W-IoT in farm animals.}
